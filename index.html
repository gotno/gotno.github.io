          <h1>Hi, I'm <a href="mailto:floyd.will@gmail.com">Will<h1></a>
        </div>
          <p>I'm a Web Developer currently looking for work in the San Francisco Bay Area.
          <p>There have always been two major passions in my life: Learning, and Building.

          <p>I taught myself to use a computer at an MSDOS terminal. In High School, I taught myself to program. I worked as a web developer right out of school. After a couple of years I decided I wanted to try building bread instead of software, so I taught myself to bake. I spent six years honing my craft in restaurants and bakeries throughout the west.</p>

          <p>In all that time, I never stopped loving code. I taught myself to use Linux. I continued to tinker with new ideas and technologies. Eventually I decided to start really engineering software again. I taught myself a wide subset of modern web technologies, and I'm ready to dig in to a whole new set of problems.</p>

          <p>I've never much known what to do with my life, but I do know this. Learning new things makes me happy. Perfecting a skill is what brings meaning to my life. Solving complex problems is something my brain seems tuned to excel at. But most of all, what I love is building things.</p>

          <p>I'm looking for the opportunity to build amazing things at a company I love.</p>
